## About Scala
### Functional Programming: 
Functional programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of a computer program that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing states and mutable data. 

### Pure functions:
A pure function is a function that has the following properties:

  - Its output or return value is the same for same set of inputs/arguments.
  - Its evaluation has no side effects like: no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or I/O streams
