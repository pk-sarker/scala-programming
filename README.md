# Scala Programming
This is the code and note repository for learning Scala Programming.

## Prerequisites & Installation
* Install `Java` 8 - used JDK `1.8.0_221`
* Install `SBT` - used `1.3.3`
* Install IDE of your choice which supports Scala (IDEA Community Edition with Scala plugin is preferred)- Used `2.11.12` and `2.13.1`

## Install references:
* https://www.scala-lang.org/download/2.12.6.html
* [Windows] https://www.journaldev.com/7456/download-install-scala-linux-unix-windows

## About Scala
### Object Oriented Programming:
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

### Functional Programming: 
Functional programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of a computer program that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing states and mutable data. 

### Pure function:
A pure function is a function that has the following properties:

  - Its output or return value is the same for same set of inputs/arguments.
  - Its evaluation has no side effects like: no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or I/O streams
### Immutable
In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.

### Scala
Scala is a modern multi-paradigm programming language designed to express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. It is a general-purpose programming language providing support for functional programming and a strong static type system.

Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine. Scala provides language interoperability with Java, so that libraries written in either language may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code. Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, and uses a curly-brace syntax reminiscent of the `C` programming language.

Scala is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object. Types and behaviors of objects are described by classes and traits. Classes can be extended by subclassing, and by using a flexible mixin-based composition mechanism as a clean replacement for multiple inheritance.

Scala is also a functional language in the sense that every function is a value. Scala provides a lightweight syntax for defining anonymous functions, it supports higher-order functions, it allows functions to be nested, and it supports currying.

Scala is statically typed. Scalaâ€™s expressive type system enforces, at compile-time, that abstractions are used in a safe and coherent manner. Scala has a built-in type inference mechanism which allows the programmer to omit certain type annotations. Type inference means the user is not required to annotate code with redundant type information.
